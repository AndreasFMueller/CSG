constructive solid geometry package

This set of tools is intended for use in writing programs that construct
mathematical models. It hopes to provide to primitive methods that are
somewhat more useful for the construction of mathematical models than
the usual geometry packages do. E.g. it should be simple to create the graph
of a function in any type of coordinate system.
